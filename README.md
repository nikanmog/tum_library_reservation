# Accessibility tool for seat reservation in the TUM university library

The TUM library reservation system has massive flaws in its design (all seats are usually gone within 10-15 seconds)
which makes it impossible for non-cs students or people with disabilities to book a seat in the library. I am sharing
this tool for free because I believe everyone should have a fair chance of reserving a seat.

Please use the tool responsibly and do not send spam requests to university servers.
